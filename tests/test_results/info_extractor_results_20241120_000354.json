This includes system standards, trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, and commercial symbols, printed or online materials, and an Operations Manual.  A typical 1-Tom-Plumber business Unit offers professional, prompt, and punctual drain cleaning and plumbing services focused on emergency services and repairs for commercial and residential properties. The franchise model updates traditional industry approaches with modern marketing and pricing models. Services may vary by location; however, new construction plumbing installations or planned remodeling of existing plumbing fixtures for commercial or residential properties are prohibited. Each franchisee is assigned a primary operating area and operates from a central office, primarily for administrative functions and secure storage. Customer-accessible showrooms or design centers are not permitted. Marketing efforts must target the designated Operating Area.  The franchisor manages a call forwarding system, routing clients based on service location zip codes. Franchisees can perform services outside their Operating Area with approval. The franchisor requires specific equipment purchases, including hydrojetters and service trucks. A national account program may be available, offering franchisees referrals and requiring adherence to contract terms.",
